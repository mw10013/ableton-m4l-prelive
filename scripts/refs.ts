/**
 * A documentation site crawled into markdown with siteone-crawler, for sources that
 * only exist as web pages. The flags this produces were arrived at against the Live
 * manual; two of them are load-bearing in non-obvious ways:
 *
 * - `include` is PCRE matched against the whole absolute URL, not the path. A
 *   path-anchored regex (`^/en/...`) matches nothing, and the crawl then quietly
 *   fetches the entry page alone and exits 0 -- a failure that looks like success.
 * - Under `browser`, the tall render viewport is what makes images work. Lazy-loaded
 *   figures carry only `data-src`, so without a browser the files download but the
 *   markdown gets no `![]()` at all, and with a normal-height viewport only the first
 *   screenful of figures resolves. Rendering the page ~30000px tall puts every figure
 *   "in view" on load.
 *
 * Two things the converter does to *every* crawl, worth knowing before trusting output:
 *
 * - **Headings lose characters.** In heading lines only, `_`, `*`, `[` and `]` are each
 *   replaced by a bare `\` rather than escaped, so `cue_points` exports as `cue\points`
 *   and `number[]` as `number\\`. (`(`, `)`, `|`, `+` are escaped correctly and their
 *   `\` must be left alone.) Where an API reference names each member only in its own
 *   heading, this makes the ref ungreppable by member name -- `is_playing` went from 8
 *   hits in the HTML to 0 in the markdown. It is not repairable with crawler flags:
 *   `--replace-content` does not reach the conversion, and `--markdown-replace-content`
 *   cannot match a literal backslash. Repair after the crawl, using what follows the
 *   closing `\` to disambiguate: `\1\` before a space is a type annotation (`number[4]`),
 *   before a word char it is an eaten pair (`mod_matrix_source_1_index`); `\\` between
 *   word chars is `__str__`, elsewhere an empty `[]`.
 * - **Inline `<svg>` is dropped silently**, leaving the surrounding prose intact, so a
 *   page can lose its only diagram with nothing in the output to say so.

 * - Map ids are content hashes, not slugs. The same manual gets a new id on every

 *   is a hard failure: silently taking the wrong one yields a complete, plausible,
 *   wrong manual.
 * - Topic bodies inline their figures as base64 `data:` URIs, and those are ~98% of the
 *   bytes. They have to be extracted to files before conversion -- left alone they pass
 *   straight through into the markdown, and one topic becomes a 400KB `.md` that
 *   poisons every grep over the ref.
 * - Cross-references are `<span data-tocid=...>`, not `<a href>`. Every markdown
 *   converter flattens them to plain text, so without a rewrite the ref silently loses
 *   all of its navigation -- and in this content they outnumber real `<a>` tags roughly
